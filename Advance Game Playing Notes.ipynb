    "- Some additional information - a rule, funciton or constraint to make a brute force algorithm to work in a more optimal manner. Let's say you have a path from A-> B, but you could go into multiple path. You use a 'direct distance' heuristic to make sure this is minimal, and you keep going with this constraint.\n",
    "- A* search \n",
    "- Tic Tac Toe: The whole board is a node - you need the position of the opponent to find out what to do next, and to know what nodes are empty - hence you need to know the state of the board, in this case the HEURISTICS\n",

    "- Now you pick A, and let's say they reveal B.\n",
    "- The POSTERIOR probability now of B is 0\n",
    "- Since he revealed a door - the posterior probability of the car in the other door is increased because he 'LEFT' the door alone. There are TWO options, because HE can only open a door that YOU didn't pick. This only works because HE knows - if he didn't it's different\n",

    "#### Exponenetial Time\n",
    "- At each level we iterate down the trees, we result in more iterative nodes, and the tree notes and deependin gnodes is increasing. It's better to search at each level as opposed to searching the full depth of each one. \n",

    "- SO lets say you have a branch: 2/7 and a branch 1/8\n",
    "- For the minimizing sees the branch1, he leads to 2, and the other branch he goes 1 (the minimzer finds). Then the maximizer will pick betwene the 2 and the 1, so he picks to the 2!!!!\n",
    "### The Furthest down the tree you get the better - so we want to chop down as much of the tree as possible\n",
    "- INSTEAD - it alternates the min and max\n",
    "- So the minimzer in branch one says it's 2, and it's less than or equal to 2 (EVEN if the next branch is bigger, it doesn't matter. It then checks it and says =2).\n",
    "- Max looks at this next and says, well no point and can do either >= 2. Then next branch is <=1  - meaning he can't do any point beyond that. \n",
    "- it DOESNT Matter the other branches beyond this. It only chooses what is available.\n",
    "- We don't even have to GENERATE the moves as well as look at the branches! Doubel save. \n",
